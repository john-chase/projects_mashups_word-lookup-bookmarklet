        <p>The slow, static energies of earth and water are dominant in the early morning hours. Energizing these
            elements through movement helps to shake off sleepiness, increase focus, and contribute to healthier food
            choices.</p>

        <p> Morning exercise does not have to be a full-fledged workout. To get into the flow before you go, simply
            engage in ten minutes of stretching, rebounding, tai-chi, or dog walking. You might even decide to turn on
            uplifting music and get the whole family dancing. Whichever style of movement you choose, have fun with it
            and enjoy the process of vitalizing body and mind before taking on the day’s tasks.</p>

        <p>
            2. Enjoy Morning Sunlight
            Throughout all of human history, the body was awakened by the sun’s light. Human physiology is still
            programmed to rise in response to light. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a part of the brain that
            regulates nearly all circadian rhythm functions, is activated via special light-detecting cells at the back
            of the eye.
        </p>

        <p>To take advantage of the benefits of morning light, Ayurveda suggests waking by 6 a.m. If you don’t live in a
            particularly sunny location or wake before the sun, try using a sunrise alarm clock that mimics the sun’s
            ascent. Encourage family members who need to sleep past 6 a.m. to spend a few minutes outdoors within the
            first hour of waking. This will activate the SCN and align their body to nature’s rhythms.</p>
